"""Which attempt sequence clears a level from a fresh game: find the shortest prelude for a solved plan.

    python py/seqify.py <plan> --level 9 --pool 94
    python py/seqify.py <plan> --levelfile <level.lvl> --pool 94

A level can start differently on its first attempt (an Item Persistence / attempt-count start: the first attempt
dies, the later ones play). The solver flies its plans in a session that is already past that, so the plan it
files clears there and not necessarily from a fresh game. This replays the plan from a FRESH layer, as the plan
alone (k=0) and then after k = 1, 2, ... empty prelude attempts (`attempt=i` / `until=1` blocks, mod/plan_io.hpp),
each in a new worker session, and writes the first one that clears as `<plan>.seq.txt`. If none does, the plan
cleared only in the middle of a session: it is NOT a cold success, and this says so (exit 1).
The prelude attempts are empty: a level whose later attempts need something done in the earlier ones (an item
written by play) is not covered and shows up here as "no prelude clears".

r"""Which `g_*` global carries state out of one solve and into the next?

`dp::cliMain` was written as a process: parse a command line, load a level,
search, print, exit. Under that assumption a namespace-scope global IS
per-solve state and nothing ever had to clear one. The mod broke it -- it calls
cliMain in-process dozens of times per level (dp/src/dpcore.cpp), and the
cold suite's `--one-session` runs all 22 levels in one game -- so every such
global now reaches the NEXT call. `dp/src/dp/reset.hpp` is the answer to that,
and `p1::resetSessionState` (src/mod/plan_io.hpp) is the mod's own copy of the
same contract.

Both are hand-maintained lists, which is the whole problem: a global landed
without a line there leaks silently, and a launch-per-level regression can
never see it. CONTRIBUTING.md records one that sat under a green 22/22 for months
(one level's moving-geometry recording adopted by the next), and on 2026-09-04
three more landed the same way (g_anchorState, g_seedPartialOk, g_seedPartial,
fixed in 9ceaabe). This script is the guard.

What it does:

  1. enumerates every namespace-scope `g_*` variable under dp/src/dp and src,
     namespace-qualified, with type and initialiser;
  2. computes what each reset entry point actually clears, by TRANSITIVE
     CLOSURE over the functions it calls (see RESET COVERAGE below -- a plain
     grep of reset.hpp is wrong for the mod, whose reset delegates to
     grouptrace::reset, secsolve::reset, itermap::clear and friends);
  3. checks the remainder against the allowlist below, which records a human's
     classification of each one, and exits non-zero on anything not accounted
     for -- so adding a global forces a decision rather than passing silently.

RESET COVERAGE -- method and its false-negative risks
-----------------------------------------------------
Name matching alone is not enough, and each of these has bitten:

  * comments.   reset.hpp names g_levelCsv, g_progress and g_rotCompute in
                prose only. Stripped before matching, or they read as covered.
  * delegation. resetSessionState clears most of the mod's state through
                calls. Followed transitively, entry points below.
  * loops.      `for (auto& f : g_frameLv) f.reset();` and
                `for (int b = 0; b < 32; ++b) g_touchFireT[b] = -1;` never put
                the name next to a plain `=`. Matched as range-for subject and
                as subscripted assignment.
  * struct-wide assignment. `g_cfg = Config{}` (hooks_playlayer.cpp) resets a
                whole struct's worth of settings in one statement. The members
                are not globals so they are out of scope here, but the same
                shape would hide a global inside an aggregate -- and would be
                missed. No such case exists today; MEMBERWISE below is the
                place to record one if it appears.
  * reads.      A name appearing in a reset body in a NON-mutating position is
                not coverage. Reported separately (`touched but not mutated`)
                rather than counted.
  * homonyms.   A name can be declared in several namespaces (g_on is in
                four). Keyed by the bare name, the first declaration was the
                only one in the table, and a reset of ANY of them counted for
                it: padtrace::reset clearing padtrace::g_lines stood for
                orbtrace::g_lines, which nothing clears, and solver::g_killY sat
                outside the audit behind itermap::g_killY. Globals are keyed by
                qualified name, and every token is resolved to the global it
                names from where it stands (Resolver); a token it cannot settle
                covers nothing and is printed.

Residual risk in that resolution: a using-directive at file scope in a
header reaches every header after it in the translation unit, which a file
at a time cannot see, so the tree's file-scope directives (`using namespace
p1;`) are applied everywhere, after the enclosing namespaces and the local
directives. A namespace alias would not be followed; there is none today.

Residual risk this cannot cover: a global mutated through a reference or
pointer alias, or cleared by a function reached through a function pointer.
`inline bool& g_active = g_secSearching;` (src/solver/secsolve.hpp:313) is the
one alias in the tree; it is in the mod scope, which is on a ratchet rather
than classified, so nothing here rests on it.

VERIFYING THE INSTRUMENT
------------------------
An audit that reports nothing because it matched nothing is worse than no
audit, and this one has produced that answer twice while being written (once
by excluding every file in the tree, once by calling every global constant).
So it is checked against a commit whose answer is known: at 8f1ae6b the three
globals 9ceaabe went on to reset were live defects, and

    python tools/reset_coverage.py --root <checkout of 8f1ae6b>

must report exactly g_anchorState, g_seedPartial and g_seedPartialOk more than
the same run against 9ceaabe -- no fewer, and nothing else. It does. The
built-in self-check covers the other half: every `g_` token in the tree must
resolve to a declaration the scanner parsed, so a declaration form it cannot
read is reported instead of silently dropped (that check found six globals
missing from the first draft's table).

Qualified names (2026-10-09) were checked the same two ways. The known
answer holds: 8f1ae6b against 9ceaabe is exactly the same three more. And on
the tree they landed in, every global the bare-name audit judged keeps its
verdict, but for two kinds of change: 33 globals it had not judged at all, or
had counted as reset by a homonym's reset, are now judged, and p1::suite::g_at
reads as written, through `++suite::g_at`, which the bare-name prefix pattern
could not see.

WHAT THE CLOSURE IS NOT
-----------------------
The audit that produced this file also asked, by hand and separately, "who
calls each of the mod's reset functions". That question was asked with a grep
whose namespace alternation was typed from memory --
`(dpsolve|secsolve|grouptrace|psnap|itermap|probe|clearance)::(reset|clear)`
-- and `anchors` was not in it, so `anchors::reset()` (src/mod/repair.hpp:117,
declared under `namespace anchors {` at :95) was reported as having no caller.
It has one: repair.hpp:2202, in the level-start block immediately above the
`dpsolve: start level=` line, with `anchors::onAttemptStart()` at
hooks_playlayer.cpp:184 as its per-attempt counterpart.

That miss cannot reach the verdicts here, and the reason is structural rather
than lucky. It was a BACKWARD query (who calls X) driven by a hand-enumerated
list of names. reset_set() runs FORWARD (what does X call, transitively) over
a generic `(?:(\w+)\s*::\s*)?(\w+)\s*\(`, so there is no name list in this
file to leave something out of -- it resolves probe::reset, secsolve::reset,
grouptrace::reset, padtrace::reset, orbtrace::reset and speedgate::reset
without ever being told they exist. And a missed CALLER cannot change what a
function DOES: every claim here has the form "the reset body does not mutate
this name", which depends only on that body's contents.

For dp/ the point is sharper still. resetInvocationState calls no free
function at all -- the closure enters exactly one body, its own, and follows
zero call edges -- so the dp verdicts, the only ones this file classifies,
involve no call resolution whatsoever. (Were a call edge ever missed, the
error direction is worth knowing: fewer resolved resets means MORE globals
reported unreset -- false findings rather than silence.)

    in the other root. A global's writers are wherever they are.

    Reads count. The first cut called a global constant when no write pattern

    pattern can see, and it came back "provably never assigned". So the only
    thing claimed automatically now is the honest one -- the name occurs
    NOWHERE outside its declaration, so nothing writes it and nothing reads it.
    Everything else is a judgement and needs a line in the allowlist.

B g_p2SoloFired     stored false at fixup.hpp:403 before the second half, which alone sets it (step.hpp:14192); read at fixup.hpp:408 right after
B g_fxBlockedUid    stored -1 at the top of every stepBoth (fixup.hpp:311), before the fixup lookup that sets it (fixup.hpp:344)
B g_inPressProbe    true only between step.hpp:4030 and 4033, around the one nested probe step
B g_deadKind        written with every `dead = true`: by DIE_AS in the same statement (step.hpp:230) and by the three direct deaths (deadband, maxplayy, offboard, which until 2026-10-09 left it alone); its one reader (--spiderpresslate's test after the probe step) runs only when that step died
#
# (B) set for the length of one call, a ladder or a replay, by the code that opens it.
B g_check           the mod's live channel, not a solve's state: dpcore.cpp:149-176 sets enabled/cancel; cliMain resets it at cli.hpp:5395 when a call uses it, and its CheckGuard on the way out (cli.hpp:5393)
B g_declineToLadder stored true at cli.hpp:7275 around a ladder's first call and false by its Clear guard (cli.hpp:7273/7278)
B g_declinedToLadder stored false at cli.hpp:7276 before the call that alone sets it (cli.hpp:6482); read only after it, at cli.hpp:7279
B g_dynParTasks     lent to the search's pool for one search by DynParLoan (cli.hpp:5432-5435), whose destructor stores nullptr
B g_fileSigHint     the caller's hints, not a solve's state: repair.hpp:2476 sets them before the in-process call and repair.hpp:2487 empties them after it (dp_bridge2.cpp:130-133, dpcore.cpp:36)
B g_groupSigCheck   stored false at the top of every cliMainOnce (cli.hpp:425), before the argument loop that may set it
B g_levelCacheCheck stored false at the top of every cliMainOnce (cli.hpp:426), before the argument loop that may set it
B g_prepMark        stored -1 at the top of every cliMainOnce (cli.hpp:424)
B g_hist            cleared at the start of every replay (cli.hpp:5743); its only reader is that replay's summary (cli.hpp:6302-6305)
B g_histFired       cleared at the start of every replay (cli.hpp:5744), beside g_hist
B g_histPads        cleared at the start of every replay (cli.hpp:5745), beside g_hist
B g_ladder          stored when a ladder starts (cli.hpp:7250) and 0 when it ends (cli.hpp:7255)
B g_ladderLevel     one ladder's level cache, taken only under its own g_ladder (cli.hpp:2640) and cleared when the ladder ends (cli.hpp:7256)
B g_lpc             one ladder's prefix cache, cleared when the ladder starts and when it ends (cli.hpp:7247/7257)
B g_loadPrinted     points at a local only while the level loads (cli.hpp:2660) and is stored nullptr right after (cli.hpp:2664)
B g_tpForceCol      stored at every level load from the objrects header (level_loader.hpp:363); a cached level is taken only when it was the last one loaded (the g_replayLevel / g_ladderLevel keys)
#
# (B) a payload read only below its own counter, which reset.hpp zeroes.
B g_fixupRotX       the payload of g_fixupRotSeen (reset.hpp:309); the only reader prints indices below it (cli.hpp:6587)
B g_fixupCallRotX   the payload of g_fixupCallRotSeen (reset.hpp:310); the only reader prints indices below it (cli.hpp:6581)
B g_impTrail        the ring of g_impCount (reset.hpp:96, step.hpp:2060); the only reader prints the last min(g_impCount, 8) (cli.hpp:6238-6241)
B g_vpTrail         the ring of g_vpWrites (reset.hpp:95, step.hpp:2059); the only reader prints the last min(g_vpWrites, 8) (cli.hpp:6233-6236)
B g_rotWatchUid     written only under --rotwatch (g_rotWatchLo >= 0, which reset.hpp:326 stores -1; step.hpp:918/1108), and model.hpp:386 stores -1 before the read at model.hpp:392
#
# (C) constants held as globals.
C g_ladderPrefixEvery    never written (search_dp.hpp:722)
C g_ladderPrefixMaxSnaps never written (search_dp.hpp:723)
#
# (S) process lifetime by design.
S g_envKills        a running total by design: the mod reads it through dpcore envKillsTotal() and takes differences across a span (dp_bridge.cpp:97/133)
S g_groupLayersGen  a generation number for the groups cache, bumped whenever the layers change (cli.hpp:179); the level caches compare against it, so it must outlive a call
S g_levelTextCache  a cross-call cache by design: taken only while the level text is the same text (cli.hpp:72); emptied between calls by releaseCrossCallCaches (cli.hpp:416), the mod's call when a solve is over
S g_groupLayersCache a cross-call cache by design: taken only on the same files by signature or bytes and the same hold setting (cli.hpp:133-176), rebuilt and its generation bumped otherwise (cli.hpp:237); emptied by releaseCrossCallCaches (cli.hpp:416)
S g_trigRowsCache   a cross-call cache by design: taken only while the file holds the bytes it was parsed from (triggers.hpp:805); emptied by releaseCrossCallCaches (cli.hpp:416)
S g_groupMembersCache a cross-call cache by design: taken only while the file holds the bytes it was parsed from (triggers.hpp:827); emptied by releaseCrossCallCaches (cli.hpp:416)
S g_replayLevel     a cross-call cache by design: taken only when the args, the groups generation, the csv and the files all match (cli.hpp:2645-2647), and cleared by any call that is not a replay (cli.hpp:2620)
S g_run             a level's run spans many calls by design: the mod opens and closes it (runBegin / runEnd, search_dp.hpp:2874/2965)
S g_threadSlot      a worker thread's identity, stored once when the pool's thread starts (thread_pool.hpp:15)
#
# (C) unreachable, so a stale value cannot differ from the declared default.
C g_rotCompute      declared false and the ONLY writer is `--no-rotcompute` setting it false again (cli.hpp:149); nothing can make it true, so it is constant by reachability (the known dead-flag shape)
C g_rotSeen         incremented only inside `if (g_rotCompute && ...)` at level_loader.hpp:354-357, which never runs -- permanently 0. Becomes (A) the day g_rotCompute is revived
C g_rotRouted       incremented only inside `if (g_rotCompute && ...)` at level_loader.hpp:354-362, which never runs -- permanently 0. Becomes (A) the day g_rotCompute is revived
#
# (A) PER-INVOCATION STATE THAT NOTHING CLEARS. These are the defect. Each one
#     belongs in resetInvocationState; listing it here keeps the run red until
#     it is either reset or re-argued. Ordered worst first.
#
A g_touchBoxU       REAL PER-LEVEL DATA, and the only member of its family nothing clears (g_touch, g_touchMoveTicks, g_touchFrame and g_touchFireT are all in reset.hpp). Touch-box travel coordinates filled from THIS level at triggers.hpp:457-458, read by ownTouch's 400px proximity gate at dynamics.hpp:838/893/1034. The fill is `b < 32 && b < out.size()`, so a level with fewer boxes than the previous one keeps the previous level's coordinates at indices >= out.size(). NOT SHOWN TO FIRE TODAY: all three readers index by a bit of State::trig, and this level's loader only ever assigns bits below out.size(), so the stale tail is currently unreachable. It becomes live the moment a trig bit outgrows its level's box count -- which the anchor path already shifts by re-windowing `out` (triggers.hpp:437-448) -- or a reader drops the bit gate
A g_rotSplit        declared TRUE and `--no-rotsplit` (cli.hpp:152) sets it false with nothing to set it back, so one invocation passing that flag disables rotation-orbit splitting for every later solve in the process
A g_refWatch        `--refwatch` sets it true (cli.hpp:114) and the search itself sets it false (cli.hpp:2421); gates the kid diagnostics at cli.hpp:2767/2785/3110/3270
A g_refEps          `--refeps` overwrites it (cli.hpp:119) only when the flag is present; the matching tolerance at refwatch.hpp:161-162 otherwise keeps the previous call's value
A g_refRows         the reference trace, loaded with `g_refRows[...] = r` (refwatch.hpp:125) and never cleared, so a second load MERGES two levels' reference rows into one map
A g_refParent       per-run watch state written during the search (cli.hpp:2412/3171/3278)
A g_refLostAt       per-run watch state written during the search (cli.hpp:3217/3276); `g_refLostAt < 0` is the "still tracking" test at cli.hpp:2406/3110/3270
A g_refDriftY       per-run watch state written during the search (cli.hpp:3197)
A g_refDriftVy      per-run watch state written during the search (cli.hpp:3199)
A g_refKidState     per-tick watch state written at cli.hpp:2793 -- and unlike its three siblings it is NOT re-initialised in the per-tick block at cli.hpp:2428-2430
A g_refKidFate      per-tick watch state (cli.hpp:2428/2790)
A g_refKidWhy       per-tick watch state (cli.hpp:2429/2791)
A g_refKidKey       per-tick watch state (cli.hpp:2430/2792)
A g_rotCheck        `--rotcheck` sets it true (cli.hpp:146) only when present; read at level_loader.hpp:1477
A g_shiftStat       `--shiftstat` sets it true (cli.hpp:104) only when present; read at dynamics.hpp:789/1328
A g_fireBCheck      `--firebcheck` sets it true (cli.hpp:86) only when present; gates the counters below at cli.hpp:2744
A g_fireBNoTick     `++` counter (cli.hpp:2748) that nothing zeroes, so the total printed at cli.hpp:3504 is the process's running total rather than this solve's
A g_fireBNoBit      `++` counter (cli.hpp:2749) that nothing zeroes -- same running-total defect
A g_fireBTooEarly   `++` counter (cli.hpp:2760) that nothing zeroes -- same running-total defect

# g_snapExtras (src/mod/hooks_gamelayer.cpp) was added 2026-10-09 with MOD_ALLOWLIST_DATA: it is
# index-parallel to g_snaps, a ratchet entry, filled beside it (:926) and read only through a
# g_snaps index (:1307-1309), so it has g_snaps's lifetime and is decided with it.
# The g_cpAhead line above was added 2026-10-09 when the scanner learned to read a function pointer's
# declarator (`inline bool (*g_cpAhead)(...) = nullptr;`): the four were not new, only newly
# visible. All four are hooks the mod installs once and never per session -- itermap::g_cpAhead and
# g_cpLine and secsolve::g_onActive at start-up (hooks_gamelayer.cpp:347-349), phase::g_testGap
# only by tools/phase_fixture.cpp (101/104). The fifth one the fix uncovered, g_cpFlightSummary, is
# set by dpsolve::start().
# The last two lines above were added 2026-09-29 with a reason, as the header asks: process lifetime
# by design, around the second copy of the core. g_beside (src/mod/dp_bridge.cpp) is the plain
# search beside a ladder, every field refilled by its start(); g_besideKills is summed into
# envKillsTotal(), which callers difference across a span; g_checkM, g_checkLast, g_checked and
# g_differed are the dpplainbeside=2 instrument's line (taken after every call) and running
# counts; dp2out::g_m and g_held (dp_bridge2.cpp) hold the second copy's stdout until the search
# it came from is taken or dropped. g_plainBesideMode (src/mod/repair.hpp) is set by
# dpsolve::start() on every session from cfg dpplainbeside or the settings menu.

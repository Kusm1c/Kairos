// The mod's view of the solver core (dp/).
//
// Narrow on purpose, and free of BOTH Geode and dp types. dp/ is compiled in its own
// translation unit with no cocos or Windows headers in scope -- their macros (min, max, near,
// far, small) do not survive contact with it -- and in return the mod never sees a dp:: type.
// Everything crosses this boundary as plain C++: the types below are dp/src/dpcore.hpp's, the
// core's own face, which names no dp:: type either.
//
// This is the seam Stage B is built on: the mod hands the solver the very same objrects CSV it
// writes to disk for the CLI, so the two share one parser and one model.

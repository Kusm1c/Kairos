// ============================================================
// Checkpoints for the seek bar (cfg `seekcp=S`, S ticks apart; 0 = off; S = 600 by default since
// 2026-10).
//
// A seek backwards restarts the level and fast-forwards to the target, so its cost grows with how
// far into the level the target is. On a long, heavy level that is seconds per seek even with the
// physics as cheap as it gets. With the flag on, a replay takes a checkpoint every S ticks as it
// plays -- watched at 1x or flown through by a seek -- and a seek starts from the latest one at or
// before its target, or jumps ahead to one past the player when the run has been there before.
//
// The checkpoint is the loop's strict one (cp_flight.hpp: GD's checkpoint plus the player's bytes
// and containers, the hold, the seeds, the camera, the area state), taken and restored by the same
// code the loop's flights and the human takeover use (hooks_gamelayer: cpCaptureState / cpMark /
// cpRestoreState). Only in a plain replay: not a solve, a served worker, a section run or a takeover.
//
// What says it is right: the x of every tick a head run (one from tick 0) passed is kept, and a run
// restored from a checkpoint is compared with it tick by tick. The first tick that differs drops
// every checkpoint and stops taking them for the session (`seekcp: parted` line); a seek from then
// on restarts the level as before.

// ============================================================
// The human takeover: a debugging mode (cfg `takeover=<tick>` or `takeoverx=<x>`, off by default).
//
// Where the repair loop or a section search stalls, a person can often see a way through that the
// search does not take. This mode lets them show it. The plan is flown to a point; the strict
// checkpoint the loop's checkpoint flights use (cp_flight.hpp -- taken by takeoverTake and loaded
// by takeoverRestore in hooks_gamelayer, through the same cpCaptureState / cpRestoreState) is put
// there; and from that tick on the jump button is the person's.
//
// From there the game's own checkpoints are the person's, and every one is a strict one. Practice
// mode is switched on at the point, so the game places checkpoints the way it always does -- its
// own auto-checkpoint setting, Z, a checkpoint object in the level -- and each gets a strict
// checkpoint taken between two update calls where the physics stands: one the game stores at once
// (Z, a level checkpoint) at the next update boundary; an auto checkpoint, which the game creates
// where it judges the player safe and stores only once they have outlived it, at the boundary
// after it is created, kept aside and committed when the game stores its own (dropped if the game
// lets it go). The takeover's own records are created and not stored (takeoverMark), so the
// game's practice state -- the queued Z, the markers -- stays the game's. X removes the newest,
// except the start point's. Every death goes back to the newest, never to the head. A clear, or
// the end key (setting key-takeover-end), ends the mode.
//
// What it is for, and what it is not:
//   - It is an instrument. Each attempt is written out as a whole plan from tick 0 -- the plan's
//     own inputs before the point, then the person's -- in the format every replay tool reads, so
//     the route can be flown again in GD and in the model and the first parting measured.
//   - It is never a seed. Nothing here writes where a solve reads (solutions, resumes, fixups),
//     and a person's route is no evidence that the solver can find one.
//   - The session stays open the whole time, so botDriving() holds and nothing is recorded:
//     achievements, statistics, coins and the level's own record stay blocked, and the badge says
//     HUMAN INPUT.
//
// The tick of a press is the substep GD applies it in: the handleButton hook notes g_tick, which
// is the step an injected press of the same plan is fed at (processCommands feeds step <= g_tick
// before the substep runs). Whether a recorded attempt really flies again the same way is not
// assumed: the py driver replays every attempt and compares it with this session's dump.
//
// Files, under the data root's takeover/<session>/:
//   base.plan.txt       what every attempt from the start point flies before the person
//   att_NNN.plan.txt    one per attempt, the whole plan from tick 0
//   summary.txt         one line per event (start, checkpoint, removal, restore, attempt, end)
// The per-tick state is the session's dump.csv (its attempt column). An attempt's run is its own
// rows after the checkpoint it started from, and before that the rows of the attempt that took
// that checkpoint, and so on back to the plan's own flight: each checkpoint line names the
// attempt that took it (dump=) and the checkpoint that attempt had started from (parent=).
